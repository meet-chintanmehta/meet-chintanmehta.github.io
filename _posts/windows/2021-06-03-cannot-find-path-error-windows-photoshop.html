<p>After updating Windows 10, I started to encounter the error in Adobe Photoshop while <strong>Save for the Web.</strong></p>
<p>The error simply says</p>
<pre><code>The operation could not be completed.
The system cannot find the path specified.
</code></pre>
<p>This issue is because of the Windows security feature, which you may have enabled. the feature is <strong>Controlled Folder Access</strong></p>
<p>After spending some time and trying to get the Save for the Web feature working I found the answer. It was the main problem with Windows Security/Defender. In order to solve it please follow the below steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Windows Security</li>
<li>Virus &amp; Threat Protection</li>
<li>Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings (Click on manage settings)</li>
<li>Controlled Folder Access (Click on Manage Controlled Folder Access)</li>
<li>From here there are two options
{% include post-ad.html %}
<ol>
<li>The option that I would not recommend, you can simply disable Controlled Folder Access, this will make sure any app in future won't give such an error</li>
<li>My recommended option: Add Adobe photoshop <strong>to allow through</strong>.
<ol>
<li>Click on Allow an app through Controlled folder access</li>
<li>Click on Add an allowed app</li>
<li>Select Adobe photoshop by either browsing all apps or looking into recently blocked apps</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
