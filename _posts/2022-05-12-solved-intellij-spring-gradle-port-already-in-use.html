<p>Have you ever encountered the below error in a <strong>Spring boot Gradle</strong> app on your <strong>WINDOWS</strong> machine with <strong>IntelliJ</strong> IDEA?</p>

<h2>Solution 1: Find and Kill the process consuming the port</h2>
<ol>

		Use the below command in the WINDOWS command prompt using ADMINISTRATOR or WINDOWS PowerShell using ADMINISTRATOR <br /><code>  netstat -a -n -p tcp -o | findstr 49415
	</code> <br />The result of the above command could be either <br /><code>NO RECORDS</code>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> &nbsp; <br /><code>TCP    192.168.1.32:49415     52.226.139.180:443     ESTABLISHED     7536</code> <br />Note down the Process ID - last digits <code>7536</code> in our case.</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Kill the process</h3>
		In order to kill the process using the below command <br /><code>kill --pid-- </code> <br />that is <br /><code>kill 7536</code></li>
